# Customizing the NLP engine in Presidio Analyzer

Presidio uses NLP engines for two main tasks: NER based PII identification,
and feature extraction for downstream rule based logic (such as leveraging context words for improved detection).
While Presidio comes with an open-source model (the `en_core_web_lg` model from spaCy),
additional NLP models and frameworks could be plugged in, either public or proprietary.
These models can be trained or downloaded from existing NLP frameworks like [spaCy](https://spacy.io/usage/models),
[Stanza](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/stanza) and
[transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers).

In addition, other types of NLP frameworks [can be integrated into Presidio](developing_recognizers.md#machine-learning-ml-based-or-rule-based).

## Setting up a custom NLP model

- [spaCy or stanza](nlp_engines/spacy_stanza.md)
- [transformers](nlp_engines/transformers.md)

## Configure Presidio to use the new model

Configuration can be done in two ways:

- **Via code**: Create an `NlpEngine` using the `NlpEnginerProvider` class, and pass it to the `AnalyzerEngine` as input:

    ```python
    from presidio_analyzer import AnalyzerEngine, RecognizerRegistry
    from presidio_analyzer.nlp_engine import NlpEngineProvider

    # Create configuration containing engine name and models
    configuration = {
        "nlp_engine_name": "spacy",
        "models": [{"lang_code": "es", "model_name": "es_core_news_md"},
                    {"lang_code": "en", "model_name": "en_core_web_lg"}],
    }

    # Create NLP engine based on configuration
    provider = NlpEngineProvider(nlp_configuration=configuration)
    nlp_engine_with_spanish = provider.create_engine()

    # Pass the created NLP engine and supported_languages to the AnalyzerEngine
    analyzer = AnalyzerEngine(
        nlp_engine=nlp_engine_with_spanish, 
        supported_languages=["en", "es"]
    )

    # Analyze in different languages
    results_spanish = analyzer.analyze(text="Mi nombre es Morris", language="es")
    print(results_spanish)

    results_english = analyzer.analyze(text="My name is Morris", language="en")
    print(results_english)
    ```

- **Via configuration**: Set up the models which should be used in the [default `conf` file](https://github.com/microsoft/presidio/blob/main/presidio-analyzer/presidio_analyzer/conf/default.yaml).

    An example Conf file:

    ```yaml
    nlp_engine_name: spacy
    models:
        -
        lang_code: en
        model_name: en_core_web_lg
        -
        lang_code: es
        model_name: es_core_news_md 
    ner_model_configuration:
    labels_to_ignore:
    - O
    model_to_presidio_entity_mapping:
        PER: PERSON
        LOC: LOCATION
        ORG: ORGANIZATION
        AGE: AGE
        ID: ID
        DATE: DATE_TIME
    low_confidence_score_multiplier: 0.4
    low_score_entity_names:
    - ID
    - ORG
    ```

    The `ner_model_configuration` section contains the following parameters:

  - `labels_to_ignore`: A list of labels to ignore. For example, `O` (no entity) or entities you are not interested in returning.
  - `model_to_presidio_entity_mapping`: A mapping between the transformers model labels and the Presidio entity types.
  - `low_confidence_score_multiplier`: A multiplier to apply to the score of entities with low confidence.
  - `low_score_entity_names`: A list of entity types to apply the low confidence score multiplier to.

    The [default conf file](https://github.com/microsoft/presidio/blob/main/presidio-analyzer/presidio_analyzer/conf/default.yaml) is read during the default initialization of the `AnalyzerEngine`. Alternatively, the path to a custom configuration file can be passed to the `NlpEngineProvider`:

    ```python
    from presidio_analyzer import AnalyzerEngine, RecognizerRegistry
    from presidio_analyzer.nlp_engine import NlpEngineProvider

    LANGUAGES_CONFIG_FILE = "./docs/analyzer/languages-config.yml"

    # Create NLP engine based on configuration file
    provider = NlpEngineProvider(conf_file=LANGUAGES_CONFIG_FILE)
    nlp_engine_with_spanish = provider.create_engine()

    # Pass created NLP engine and supported_languages to the AnalyzerEngine
    analyzer = AnalyzerEngine(
        nlp_engine=nlp_engine_with_spanish, 
        supported_languages=["en", "es"]
    )

    # Analyze in different languages
    results_spanish = analyzer.analyze(text="Mi nombre es David", language="es")
    print(results_spanish)

    results_english = analyzer.analyze(text="My name is David", language="en")
    print(results_english)
    ```

    In this examples we:
        a. create an `NlpEngine` holding two spaCy models (one in English: `en_core_web_lg` and one in Spanish: `es_core_news_md`).
        b. define the `supported_languages` parameter accordingly.
        c. pass requests in each of these languages.

    !!! note "Note"
        Presidio can currently use one NER model per language via the `NlpEngine`. If multiple are required,
        consider wrapping NER models as additional recognizers ([see sample here](https://github.com/microsoft/presidio/blob/main/docs/samples/python/example_remote_recognizer.py)).

## Leverage frameworks other than spaCy, Stanza and transformers for ML based PII detection

In addition to the built-in spaCy/Stanza/transformers capabilities, it is possible to create new recognizers which serve as interfaces to other models.
For more information:

- [Remote recognizer documentation](adding_recognizers.md#creating-a-remote-recognizer) and [samples](../samples/python/integrating_with_external_services.ipynb).
- [Flair recognizer example](../samples/python/flair_recognizer.py)

For considerations for creating such recognizers, see the [best practices for adding ML recognizers documentation](developing_recognizers.md#machine-learning--ml--based-or-rule-based).
